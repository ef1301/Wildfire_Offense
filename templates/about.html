        <h2> Why Australia? </h2>
            <p> Many of Australia's native plants are fire prone and very combustible, while numerous species depend on fire to
                regenerate. Indigenous Australians have long used fire as a land management tool and it continues to be used to
                clear land for agricultural purposes and to protect properties from intense, uncontrolled fires.</p>

    <div>
        <h2> The Risk </h2>
            <p> Firefighters are susceptible to burns, smoke inhalation and crush injuries from collapsing structures. They can suffer
            from heat exhaustion, as well as long-term job-related illnesses such as asthma, persistent coughing, heart disease,
            cancer and lung damage.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> Values </h2>
            <p> As members of the Fire Service, firefighters share a responsibility to project an ethical 
            character of professionalism, integrity, compassion, loyalty, and honesty in all that they do.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> About Us </h2>
            <p>Firefighters or firemen are people whose job is to put out fires and rescue people. Besides fires, firefighters rescue
            people and animals from car wrecks, collapsed buildings, stuck elevators and many other emergencies. Firefighting is a
            job which requires bravery, strength, quick thinking and a wide range of skills.  </p>
